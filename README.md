# FFXLightningDodge
A brute force solution on how to dodge 200+ lightning bolts in Final fantasy X HD Remaster.
The script sends the scancode for the button that is used to dodge when a specified point in the game window shows a big shift in brightness.

Instead of fixing a problem with the game stops recieving automated input, I did a simple workaround to ignore that issue. 
The issue resets by swapping between programs. Instead of handling this properly, it was simpler to just make the script select the program by using the mouse. 
I might look into a better solution in the future.

The game needs to be played in windowed mode.
Follow the instructions in the console.
Currently, the dodge button is set to 'N'.
